For your week, you're the cookie czar.  Buy or bake whatever kind of
cookies you want and like, and don't feel compelled to get high-end or
fancy stuff.  We have had one request that Oatmeal Raisin cookies be
part of the selection, if at all possible.  Please refer any
complainers to Ken Clarkson, who will be happy to enlist them as a new
volunteer.

Eight bags of Pepperidge Farm-style cookies seems to be about the
right amount of cookies for one Friday.
