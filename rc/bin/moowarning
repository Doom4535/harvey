Next unix room milk duty goes to:

$next

You may bring in your own milk or buy it at the
cafeteria.  Gallons are now available in the cafeteria
(in the fridge where they have small cartons of milk).

At the moment we're consuming about 4-5 gallons a
week.  Check the refrigerator before buying and try to 
keep the stockpile of approximately 1 gallon during the 
week.  If we stock more, it goes bad(!!!).  Please bring
in 1% and/or 2% milk, hardly anybody prefers whole
milk these days.
