.SH SYNOPSIS
.B audio
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Audio
is a shell script that binds in the
.I lib/audio
directory from appropriate places and then
execs
.IR games/agui ,
which is a digital audio jukebox.
This program is a GUI that can walk through a
database of songs.
If the GUI is asked to play a song,
it runs
.I games/pac4dec
which decompresses PAC audio files in real time.
For this to work,
the computer must be equipped with an audio device,
it must be fast enough to do the conversion (about 50 Mips)
and the bandwidth to the converter must be on the order
of 20Kbs.

Typing a word at the keyboard will search for

artist field or the title field.

for songs containing all the words.
A word may end in * and will match all
words starting with the string before the *.
A word starting with . will fetch a list of
