	Changes since the last rc I put on sources (roughly 1 April 2014).

the general assumption is now that rc is first a plan 9 shell, with
POSIX supported secondarily.  non-plan-9 code is pushed into foreign.
`cd foreign; make' builds on APE at least, with result in
foreign/build/rc.  No idea if it will compile on Windows and that
matters less each day.

utf parsing is more careful and now processes badrunes/badrunes and
badrunes/badrunes.old correctly.  utf is assumed throughout, not ascii
nor some generic multi-byte character encoding.  the usual plan 9 utf
and rune functions are used instead of rc's own.  made unicode chars
acceptable in identifiers.

getflags.[ch] are gone.

rc.h reorganised to remove some #ifdefs.

removed a limit on environment variable length and stopped using
*print and libString, which saves a little space and makes better use
of rc's own mechanisms.  (yacc still uses *print for debugging.) made
rewind() work on openstr buffers.

catch and print wait status messages containing "error in demand
load".  in particular, this makes visible failures when running some
binaries (e.g., openssl) via vacfs (and changes to vacfs will be
forthcoming to cope).

error messages now identify the input file and line number of syntax
errors and the like.
