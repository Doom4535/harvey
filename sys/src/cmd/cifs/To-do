more complete (server crossing) DFS support

MAC signing
also put modified mschap interface into factotum

Support for FindNotify rather thn 1 second timer for directory caching

Jumbo packets

reference count open files so multiple opens on the same file causes
a single open at the server.

multithread the client

queue multiple requests to implement large reads/writes rather than
un-signed requests.

make use of AndX to combine requests?

implement permissions off ACLs - Everyone is known, need to find group and user.

why can I not make multiple connections from the same server, I use a random number
for the MUID already

RPC support for file owner/group and ACL/permissioms.

DFS lookups should occur on every use not just on walks,
this will allow timeout and refresh of DFS referals.

ping cache entries should timeout - maybe after 1 hour,
could be done by a background process.

also need to validate the MACs used for each host as we can have 2 hosts
with 2 IP addresses but the same MAC (Microsoft Redundant Blade setup).

attach specifier
	windows printer support - use a special attach verb "print"

	use atatch specifier "ctrl" for control files

	default attach specifier is "files"
