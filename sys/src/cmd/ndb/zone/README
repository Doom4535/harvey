axfr does zone transfer from a remote dns server.  zonefresh.rc is a
script that tries to format axfr's output nicely as a plan9 NDB file
to standard output.

zonefresh has one option, -s which causes it to write its output to
/lib/ndb/sec.domain.dom, taking care not to truncate the file if the
zone transfer fails.

This is typically used to keep a local ndb file for a remote dns
server up to date so we can provide a seccondary dns service.

run from cron as:

15 5 * * *	cpu	zonefresh  -s ns.domain.dom domain.dom
