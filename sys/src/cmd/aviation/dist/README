navigation programs:

all run from an object database.
database source is in files
air1, air2, air3	airports
vor1			vors
ndb1			ndbs
spc1 spc2		other - mostly intersections

an object is specified by name or name.type
type is a, v, n, i for airport, vor, ndb, intersection.

the database is created (in /usr/ken/lib/obj) by
the program load. see the makefile. the pathname
is defined in obj.h.

the basic program is
dist obj1 obj2 ...
gives the great circle distances and magnetic
bearings between the objects.

dme obj radial dist
will print a latitude, longitude in the form
of the object source files. this is used
to create more objects, especially intersections.
note that the database has to exist.

plan obj1 obj2
will give a minimun distance path from obj1 to
obj2 such that you are never more than 50 miles
from a vor. an option will change the 50.

path obj1 obj2 ...
will calculate a great circle route connecting
the objects. it will print all objects
that are within 50 miles of the route. it prints
the distance along the route and the lateral
distance to the object, + is right - is left.
an option will change the 50.

cross obj
will print all objects within 100 miles of the
given object along with distance and magnetic bearing.
this program has bugs.

ft obj1 obj2 ...
will print all terminal forecast weather stations
that are closest to some point along the great
circle route of objects. the output is meant to
be piped into w.

fp obj1 obj2 ...
same as ft, but prints area forcasts.

fd obj1 obj2 ...
same as ft, but prints winds aloft forcasts.

warning: the database files are very stale.
do not use for navigation. the program also
generates routes over water, through prohibited
areas and generally in straight lines.
