This directory contains a port of the Plan 9 9k kernel to 64-bit RISC-V
systems, specifically RV64GC systems.  It currently only runs on the Microchip
Polarfire Icicle, Hifive Unmatched, and discontinued pre-release Beagle V
boards, but should be easily adaptable to future RV64GC systems.  Set RVARCH
to the target architecture (e.g., "pf" for icicle, "um" for Unmatched).

See doc/*.ms for details.

To compute KTZERO for the current RVARCH,

	mk -f ktzmkfile

This ignores the value of KTZERO in arch.$RVARCH and computes it from other
constants, notably BANK0SIZE, which is GB by default.
