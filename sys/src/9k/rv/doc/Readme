The attached .tgz file should have everything you need to compile Plan 9
riscv64 kernels and commands.  I plan to continue improving the port and
adapting to other RISC-V systems.

Note the documentation and manual pages.  The compilers are ic (rv32) and jc
(rv64), built from the same sources.  Note that I've widened the last argument
to memset (but this is *not* required, you can choose not to).

Edit the tops of 9k/rv*/mkfile before mking.  The "te" architecture is
tinyemu.  mk will generate 9tecpu.bin files that can be executed directly by
tinyemu.  On hardware, interrupt u-boot and type

	dhcp 0x90000000; bootm 0x90000000 - ${fdtcontroladdr}

to load ndb's

	bootf=/riscv64/9pfcpu.uim

All these kernels are cpu kernels; the only peripherals supported so far are
uarts, ethernet, sd and mmc cards.

Almost everything I have tried has worked (gs, of course, never really works
right).  Crypto remains marginal.

Good luck, and let me know if you have questions.
